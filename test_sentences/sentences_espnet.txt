THE COMMISSION ALSO RECOMMENDS.
THAT THE SECRET SERVICE CONSCIOUSLY SET ABOUT THE TASK OF INCULCATING AND MAINTAINING THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE AND ESPRIT, FOR ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL.
THIS INVOLVES TIGHT AND UNSWERVING DISCIPLINE AS WELL AS THE PROMOTION OF AN OUTSTANDING DEGREE OF DEDICATION AND LOYALTY TO DUTY.
THE COMMISSION EMPHASIZES THAT IT FINDS NO CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ASSASSINATION.
